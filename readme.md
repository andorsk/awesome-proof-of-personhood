## Relevant Papers

* [Personhood: The Killer
  Credential?](https://www.vennfactory.com/blog-post/personhood-the-killer-credential) :
  Blog post by Eve Maler describing the impact of a personhood credential on the
  decentralized ecosystem.  
* [Personhood credentials: Artificial intelligence and the value of
privacy-preserving tools to distinguish who is real
online](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.07892v1) : Made in August 31, this paper was
created with 31 authors and leaders from the Identity space. It explores the
problem space and expresses the importance of a solution, without explicitly
defining _the_ solution.

  personhood?](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html) :
  Blog post in July 2023 from Vitalik Buterin about his thoughts on biometric
  proof of personhood.

## Efforts 

### Biometrics Based

- [Aadhaar](https://uidai.gov.in/) : Aadhaar is India’s national biometric
  identification system, managed by the Unique Identification Authority of India
  (UIDAI). It provides a 12-digit unique identity number for residents based on
  fingerprint and iris scans, aiming to streamline access to government services
  and prevent identity fraud.
- [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/): UR Codes, 3D Liveness, OCR, Barcode/NFC for
  KYC Onboarding + 3D Face Matching for Ongoing Re-Verification
- [Humanode](https://humanode.io/): Humanode combines facial recognition
  biometrics with blockchain technology to create a proof-of-personhood
  mechanism.
- [Humanity Protocol](https://www.humanity.org/) : Humanity Protocol is a highly scalable and
  decentralized EVM based solution that enables any online actor to be cryptographically proven as a re
  al human through its Proof-of-Humanity mechanisms based on biometric data. 
- [Realeyes](https://www.realeyesit.com/): General hardware proof of person, livelieness detection,
  sentiment detection. 
- [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/): Worldcoin’s World ID is a decentralized
  digital identity verified through biometric iris scans. This project aims to
  enable equitable access to digital economies and prevent fraud and Sybil
  attacks.

### Proof Of Work Based

- [Gitcoin Passport](https://www.gitcoin.co/) : Users collect “stamps” from
  different authenticators around web2 and web3, such as Bright ID, Proof of
  Humanity, Twitter, and Google to form a reputation score.
- [Idena](https://www.idena.io/): Idena employs regular checkpoint rituals —
  synchronous validation sessions — to certify a participants’ humanness for the
  consequent epoch. The validation requires solving of flips-puzzles easy for a
  human, difficult for a bot.

### Social Graph Based

- [Greencheck](https://greencheck.world) : provides a bot-resistant
  representation of you that can be used across communities and independent of
  application, completely under your control by building a graph of claims with
  validation.
- [Proof of Humanity](https://proofofhumanity.id/): similar to Bright ID, a
  system combining social verification with video submission to create a
  Sybil-proof list of humans.
- [Bright ID](https://www.brightid.org/): similar to proof of humanity, a
  system combining social verification with video submission to create a
  Sybil-proof list of humans.
- [Circles](https://www.aboutcircles.com/) : An approach to solve the UBI
  problem using crypto-currency. Individuals vouch for eachother to form a trust
  network.
- [Encointer](https://encointer.org/): A Swiss association. Participants in each Encointer
  community are randomly assigned to periodic small, physical gatherings at a
  randomly selected location in their local area. When it commences, each
  participant scans the QR code of the other attendees to confirm their presence
  and the attestations are recorded on the highly secure Kusama blockchain
  ledger. As all Encointer gatherings take place at the same time, it is
  impossible to attend more than one event during each cycle. This makes it
  impossible to validate more than one Encointer account.
- [First Person Project](https://www.firstperson.network/): People focused decentralized trust graphs on a non-profit cooperative that
  requires anchoring on personhood credentials.  The First Person Network is a global digital utility that enables trusted connections between individuals, communities, and organizations.
  
### Identity Proofs

- [Veranon](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/labs-veranon/): VerAnon uses Semaphore to enable unique and anonymous verification of personhood. Managers verify user identity documents, adding their Semaphore identity commitments to a group. Subjects then generate zero-knowledge proofs to show membership without revealing their actual identities. This approach helps prevent large-scale bot account creation and enhances privacy across various service providers, all while preserving unique personhood claims.
- [Billions](https://www.privado.id/blog/privado-id-introduces-billions-the-first-global-human-ai-network) : ZKP network where users verify with passport and phone.
