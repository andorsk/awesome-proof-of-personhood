A curated list of proof of personhood approaches.

## Relevant Papers

* [Personhood: The Killer
  Credential?](https://www.vennfactory.com/blog-post/personhood-the-killer-credential) :
  Blog post by Eve Maler describing the impact of a personhood credential on the
  decentralized ecosystem.  
* [Personhood credentials: Artificial intelligence and the value of
privacy-preserving tools to distinguish who is real
online](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.07892v1) : Made in August 31, this paper was
created with 31 authors and leaders from the Identity space. It explores the
problem space and expresses the importance of a solution, without explicitly
defining _the_ solution.

## Efforts 

### Biometrics Based

- [Aadhaar](https://uidai.gov.in/) : Aadhaar is India’s national biometric
  identification system, managed by the Unique Identification Authority of India
  (UIDAI). It provides a 12-digit unique identity number for residents based on
  fingerprint and iris scans, aiming to streamline access to government services
  and prevent identity fraud.
- [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/): Worldcoin’s World ID is a decentralized
  digital identity verified through biometric iris scans. This project aims to
  enable equitable access to digital economies and prevent fraud and Sybil
  attacks.
- [Humanode](https://humanode.io/): Humanode combines facial recognition
  biometrics with blockchain technology to create a proof-of-personhood
  mechanism. 

### Proof Of Work Based

- [Idena](https://www.idena.io/): Idena employs regular checkpoint rituals —
  synchronous validation sessions — to certify a participants’ humanness for the
  consequent epoch. The validation requires solving of flips-puzzles easy for a
  human, difficult for a bot.

### Social Graph Based

- [Greencheck](https://greencheck.world) : provides a bot-resistant
  representation of you that can be used across communities and independent of
  application, completely under your control by building a graph of claims with
  validation.
- [Proof of Humanity](https://proofofhumanity.id/): similar to Bright ID, a
  system combining social verification with video submission to create a
  Sybil-proof list of humans.
- [Bright ID](https://www.brightid.org/): similar to proof of humanity, a
  system combining social verification with video submission to create a
  Sybil-proof list of humans.
- [Encointer](https://encointer.org/): A Swiss association. Participants in each Encointer
  community are randomly assigned to periodic small, physical gatherings at a
  randomly selected location in their local area. When it commences, each
  participant scans the QR code of the other attendees to confirm their presence
  and the attestations are recorded on the highly secure Kusama blockchain
  ledger. As all Encointer gatherings take place at the same time, it is
  impossible to attend more than one event during each cycle. This makes it
  impossible to validate more than one Encointer account.
